## TODO:

* naming: attributes should have the type written as a suffix not as prefix
* other prefix for unwrapped values
* if let condition:

```swift
if (array.count == 0),
    let
        _a = a,
        (a.count < 0),
        _b = b
        where (b > a) {
            println(a)
}
```


## QUESTION:

* Do extensions know about private attributes/functions 

## Sample markdown
